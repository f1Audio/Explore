# 🚀 Explore – Experimental Audio Plugin Prototype  

*A novel audio plugin designed to challenge traditional effect interfaces by prioritizing exploration and experimentation.*  

## 🎛️ Overview  
**Explore** is a prototype **audio effect plugin** that redefines **user interaction** by focusing on **discovery and creativity** rather than conventional parameter adjustments.  
Built with **modern C++ and JUCE**, this project introduces **a unique interface** where users interact with sound in **a new, exploratory way**.

## ✨ Features  
🔹 **Interactive XY Pad** – Primary control interface for **dynamic, real-time manipulation**.  
🔹 **Flexible Parameter Mapping** – Assigns parameters to **X, Y, and diagonal axes**, with **reversible directions**.  
🔹 **Unlabeled Controls** – Encourages **experimental sound design** without preconceptions.  
🔹 **Randomized Parameter Layout** – Generates **unique sonic discoveries** with each session.  
🔹 **Space Exploration-Themed UI** – Featuring a **universe background** and **rocket controller** metaphor.  
🔹 **Hidden Advanced Controls** – Additional parameters (e.g., **BPM-synced delay time**) accessible only in **UI-less mode**.  
🔹 **Built with Modern C++ and JUCE** – Ensuring **cross-platform DAW compatibility**.  
🔹 **Expanded DSP Processing** – Based on my **Stereo Delay plugin**, with **additional signal processing enhancements**.
